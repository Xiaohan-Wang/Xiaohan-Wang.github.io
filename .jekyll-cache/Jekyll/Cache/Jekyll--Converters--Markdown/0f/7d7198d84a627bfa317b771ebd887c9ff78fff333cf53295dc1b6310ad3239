Note that uncertain area has prediction probability around 0.5, while prediction probability around 1 corresponds to areas with good accuracy.</p>

<p>Classes with high accuracy always have higher prediction probabilities. If Shannon entropy is deployed, as shown in the above figure, the simple class will produce a much larger gradient on each pixel than the difficult class, causing each gradient descent step is basically computed from those simple classes, and difficult classes is still not trained sufficiently. By using MSL, areas with higher confidence still have larger gradients, but their dominant effects have been reduced, allowing other difficult classes to obtain training gradients.</p>

<h4 id="class-imbalance-problem">Class imbalance problem</h4>
<p>Classes with higher accuracy always have more pixels on the label map, which leads to an imbalance in quantity.</p>

<p>regular method: introduce weighting factor αc, which is usually set as the inverse class frequency.</p>
