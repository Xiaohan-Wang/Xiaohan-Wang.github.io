  <li>duplicate several copies of the last ResNet block (Block 5, Block 6, Block 7)</li>
  <li>apply atrous convolution with rates determined by the desired output stride value (output stride = 256 if no atrous convolution is applied)</li>
  <li>multi-grid method: adopt different atrous rates within block4 to block7 in the proposed model. For example, when $\text{output stride} = 16$ and $\text{Multi Grid} = (1, 2, 4)$, the three convolutions will have $rates = 2 ¬∑ (1, 2, 4) = (2, 4, 8)$ in the block4, respectively.</li>

  <li>include batch normalization within ASPP.</li>
  <li>image level feature: apply global average pooling on the last feature map of the model, feed the resulting image-level features to a 1 √ó 1 convolution with 256 filters (and batch normalization), and then bilinearly upsample the feature to the desired spatial dimension.</li>
  <li>the improved ASPP consists of
    <ul>
      <li>one 1√ó1 convolution, and three 3 √ó 3 convolutions with rates = (6, 12, 18) when output stride = 16 (all with 256 filters and batch normalization). Note that the rates are doubled when output stride = 8.</li>
      <li>the image-level features (the rates are doubled when output stride = 8)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The resulting features from all the branches are concatenated and pass through another 1 √ó 1 convolution (with 256 filters and batch normalization) before the final 1 √ó 1 convolution which generates the final logits.</li>

  <li>‚Äúpoly‚Äù learning rate policy: the initial learning rate is
multiplied by $(1 ‚àí\text{maxiter})^{\text{power}}$ with $\text{power} = 0.9 $.</li>
  <li><strong>upsampling logits: upsample the final logits, since downsampling the groundtruths removes the fine annotations resulting in no back-propagation of details.</strong></li>
  <li>$\text{output stride}=16$ during training, and $\text{output stride}=8$ during inference to get more detailed feature map.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Both their best cascaded model (in Tab. 4) and ASPP model (in Tab. 6) (in both cases without DenseCRF post-processing or MS-COCO pre-training) already outperform DeepLabv2 (77.69% with DenseCRF and pretrained on MS-COCO) on the PASCAL VOC 2012 val set.</li>
  <li>The improvement mainly comes from including and fine-tuning batch normalization parameters in the proposed models and having a better way to encode multi-scale context.</li>
</ul>
