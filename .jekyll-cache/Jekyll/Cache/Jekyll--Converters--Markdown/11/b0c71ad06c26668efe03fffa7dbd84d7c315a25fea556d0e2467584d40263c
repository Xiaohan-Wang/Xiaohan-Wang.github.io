  <li>calculating population variance and std for the whole population using all the data</li>
  <li>e.g. What is the standard deviation of last yearâ€™s returns of the 12 funds I have invested in? In this case, we have the data for the whole population available.</li>
  <li>When using the whole population to calculate population variance, <strong>divide</strong> the sum of squared deviations from the mean <strong>by the number of items in the population</strong>.</li>

<ul>
  <li>calculating population variance and std using only a sample of data</li>
  <li>e.g. What is the standard deviation of last yearâ€™s returns of equity funds in the world? In this case, we donâ€™t have all the data available and we will have to estimate the populationâ€™s standard deviation from a sample.</li>
  <li>When using a sample to calculate population variance, <strong>divide it by the number of items in the sample less one</strong>.</li>
  <li>As a result, the calculated variance (and therefore also the standard deviation) will <strong>be slightly higher than if we would have used the population variance formula</strong>. The purpose of this little difference is to get a better and unbiased estimate of the populationâ€˜s variance (by dividing by the sample size lowered by one, we <strong>compensate for the fact that we are working only with a sample rather than with the whole population</strong>).</li>
