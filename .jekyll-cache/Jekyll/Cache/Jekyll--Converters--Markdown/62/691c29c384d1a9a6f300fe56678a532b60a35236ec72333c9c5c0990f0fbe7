  <li>Image inpainting:
    <ul>
      <li>to fill in large missing areas of the image, it can‚Äôt get ‚Äúhints‚Äù from nearby pixels</li>
      <li>a model needs to both understand the content of an image, as well as produce a plausible hypothesis for the missing parts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>a standard pixel-wise reconstruction loss</strong>: only the reconstruction loss produces blurry results</li>
  <li><strong>an adversarial loss</strong>: adding the adversarial loss results in much sharper predictions</li>
</ol>

  <li>Encoder-decoder pipeline:
    <ul>
      <li>encoder: produces a latent feature representation of that image</li>
      <li>decoder: takes this feature representation and produces the missing image content
        <ul>
          <li>a series of five up-convolutional layers (upsampling followed by convolution)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>channel-wise fully-connected layer</strong>: connect the encoder and the decoder
        <ul>
          <li>directly propagate information from one corner of the feature map to another corner (so that we can better capture global semantic information)</li>
          <li>essentially a fully-connected layer with groups: only propagates information within feature maps, but it has no parameters connecting different feature maps</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Loss function:
    <ul>
      <li>reconstruction (L2) loss: 
  <img src="/img/15942152334674.jpg" width="50%" height="100%" />
        <ul>
          <li>capturing the overall structure of the missing region and coherence with regards to its context, but prefer a blurry solution (because the expectation of all possible values minimizes the mean squared pixel-wise error)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>adversarial loss: 
  <img src="/img/15942164552075.jpg" width="55%" height="100%" />
        <ul>
          <li>tries to make prediction look real, and has the effect of picking a particular mode from the distribution</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Region masks
 <img src="/img/15942173051541.jpg" width="60%" height="100%" /></p>

    <ul>
      <li>central region</li>
      <li>random block</li>
      <li>random region (recommended)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Random block and random region produce a similarly general feature, while significantly outperforming the central region features.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Pool-free encoders: replacing all pooling layers with convolutions of the same kernel size and stride. (Intuitively, there is no reason to use pooling for reconstruction based networks.)</li>

  <li>Semantic Inpainting
<img src="/img/15942140401143.jpg" width="80%" height="100%" />
    <ul>
      <li>The encoder and discriminator architecture is similar to that of discriminator in [1], and decoder is similar to generator in [1].</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Feature Learning
 <img src="/img/15942140603053.jpg" width="55%" height="100%" />
    <ul>
      <li>For consistency with prior work, this paper use AlexNet as its encoder in this part.</li>
      <li>The authors did not manage to make the adversarial loss converge with AlexNet, so they used just the reconstruction loss.</li>
