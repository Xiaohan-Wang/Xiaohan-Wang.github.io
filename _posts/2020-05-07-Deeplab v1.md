#### Take away message
1. two technical hurdles in the application of DCNNs to image labeling tasks: signal downsampling, and spatial ‘insensitivity’ (invariance).
2. signal downsampling: reduction of signal resolution incurred by the repeated max-pooling -> employ the atrous algorithm (其实就是空洞卷积)
3. spatial insensitivity: object-centric decisions from a classifier requires invariance to spatial transformations, inherently limiting the spatial accuracy of the DCNN model -> capture fine details by employing a fully-connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) + multi-scale prediction

#### Model
依然修改自VGG-16

##### efficient feature extraction: atrous algorithm + reducing model
1. To compute scores more densely at target stride of 8 pixels:  
    <img src="/img/15888799732428.jpg" width="70%" height="100%">
    1. convert the fully-connected layers of VGG-16 into convolutional ones and run the network in a convolutional fashion on the image at its original resolution
    2. instead of subsampling after the last two max-pooling layers in the network, use the convolutional filters with an input stride of 2 or 4 pixels, respectively.

2. After converting the network to a fully convolutional one, the first fully connected layer has 4,096 filters of large 7×7 spatial size and becomes the computational bottleneck.
    1. Use filters with 4×4 (or 3×3) spatial size but with the same receptive fields.
    2. reducing the number of channels at the fully connected layers from 4,096 down to 1,024.

##### detail boundary recovery: fully-connected CRF + multi-scale prediction
1. fully-connected CRF

1. multi-scale prediction
    attach to the input image and the output of each of the first four max pooling layers a two-layer MLP (first layer: 128 3x3 convolutional filters, second layer: 128 1x1 convolutional fil- ters) whose feature map is concatenated to the main network’s last layer feature map. The aggregate feature map fed into the softmax layer is thus enhanced by 5 * 128 = 640 channels.
