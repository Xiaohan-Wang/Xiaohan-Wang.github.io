#### Take away message
1. 观察到source domain prediction是over-confident / low entropy，而target domain prediction是under-confident / high entropy
2. direct entropy minimization
3. structure adaptation: adversarial learning 

#### Model
![-w930](/img/15850310997747.jpg)

class ratio prior:  
Entropy minimization can get biased towards some easy classes. Therefore, sometimes it is beneficial to guide the learning with some prior. 此处根据class ratio prior设计了另一个Loss来guide learning.

#### Result
1. In general, AdvEnt works better than MinEnt. By combining results of the two models MinEnt and AdvEnt, we observe a decent boost in performance, compared to results of single models.

1. oracle performance (trained on source and target)

#### Tricks
1. Training on specific entropy ranges.
2. Using class-ratio prior.

#### Insight
1. 找source domain结果/中间feature map具备、而target domain不具备的性质，用adversarial learning (e.g. cross entropy)
